  ╰┈➤ I go by Yumi! I am a digital artist and an animator. I'm socially awkward person. I rarely interact with other people when I'm bored or when my friends are offline. I might end up saying random stuff or just stay quiet throughout the conversation because I ***REALLY*** don't know how to start a conversation. Though, please don't be weird around me unless we are friends. I'll get a bit more talkative when we're close! (Sometimes or much likely would talk about art hihie.) Also please only (and strictly) use she/her pronouns on me, thank you!!

  My pookies!! Ily guys so muchh💙🩵🤍
