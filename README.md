  ╰┈➤ I go by Yumi! I am a digital artist and an animator.
  
  · I'm a socially awkward person and might rarely interact with anyone whenever I'm bored or when my friends are offline. Sometimes I might end up saying random stuff or just stay quiet all throughout because I don't know where to begin the conversation or how to express myself properly around strangers.

  As for my pronouns, I preferably want people to use only she/her, though they/them is fine too. ^^
